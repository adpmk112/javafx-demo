# JavaFX Window Project

This repository contains a series of JavaFX mini-projects that I developed and tested during my training period. The focus of these projects was to explore and apply JavaFX for creating desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.

In addition to JavaFX, these projects were an opportunity to solidify my understanding of core Java concepts before diving into more advanced frameworks like Spring.
